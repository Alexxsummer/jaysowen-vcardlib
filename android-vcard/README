Compile requirements
====================

 * Java 5 JDK
 * Ant
 * CopyLibs
   o included in NetBeans IDE 6.7
 * Apache Commons Codec 1.3
   o http://commons.apache.org/codec/

If you wish to use other libraries than the ones provided in lib/ directory
(e.g. package maintainers may want this) you can specify classpaths to
individual libraries in file lib/nblibraries.properties. Variables ending with
'.classpath' will be of interest to you.


Compiling library
=================

In sources root directory (where build.xml is located) run this command:

 $ ant clean jar

All the sources should be compiled in the build/ directory. In the dist/
directory the resulting android-vcard.jar should be created, together with all 
needed libraries.
